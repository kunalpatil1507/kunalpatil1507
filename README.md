# 👋 Hi, I’m Kunal Patil

I am an Information Technology undergraduate focused on **applied Machine Learning and backend systems**, with a strong interest in building **production-ready, open-source software**.

My primary expertise lies in **Computer Vision, AI-powered analytics, and ML-backed backend services**, where I work on taking research-level ideas into scalable, real-world systems.

I enjoy contributing to codebases where **clean architecture, reproducibility, and real-world impact** matter more than quick demos.

## 🎯 Current Focus
- Open-source contributions in **ML / Computer Vision**
- Backend systems for **model inference & analytics**
- Preparing for **Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2026**

## 🧠 Core Technical Strengths

### Machine Learning & AI
- Computer Vision (Object Detection, Gesture Recognition, Safety Analytics)
- Deep Learning (CNNs, transfer learning, PyTorch, TensorFlow)
- Data pipelines, evaluation, and model optimization

### Backend & Systems
- Python-based ML services (Flask, FastAPI)
- REST APIs for real-time inference
- System design for ML-in-production
- MERN stack (for ML-integrated applications)

### Tools & Practices
- Git & GitHub (PRs, reviews, issue discussions)
- Docker (basic)
- Cloud deployment (AWS, Firebase, Render)
- Clean code, documentation-first development

## 🏆 Highlight Project
**AI-powered Women Safety Analytics Platform**  
🏅 Winner – Smart India Hackathon 2024  

A real-time safety monitoring system combining:
- Computer vision models
- Backend decision logic
- Web & mobile interfaces

(Repository links contain architecture, datasets, and deployment details.)

## 🌱 Open Source & Learning Philosophy
I believe good open-source contributors:
- Read code before writing code
- Communicate clearly with maintainers
- Optimize for maintainability over hacks

I am actively contributing to open-source projects and aim to work closely with mentors and communities during **GSoC 2026**.
